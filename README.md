# Project-1
Create a website (possible future app) that pairs together users of similar interests (based off a series of questions) in the same feed. 
Users will have their own usernames and are added in the same feed. Users are able to friend other users. 
All posts made by users will be stored on their individual profile. 
- Will match users based on a combination of personal, philosophical, psychological, etc. questions.
- Will place users into a pool of other users that correlates with the results of the test
Ideas for algorithm to match like users:
- Similarity percentage score
